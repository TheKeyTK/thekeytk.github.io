I"Ê<p>You have probably heard that Microsoft will soon disable macros in the documents that are coming from the internet (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked" target="blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked</a>). It got me thinking, what are the other alternatives to gain initial access to the target‚Äôs environment, what kind of payloads can we deliver?</p>

<p>While browsing Mitre‚Äôs att&amp;ck I have come across a pretty old technique, known as the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002/" target="blank">right-to-left override attack (rtlo)</a> . If you have never heard of it, I will try to explain it briefly.
Some languages write from left to right side, like English and German for example. Some languages write from right to left side, like Arabic and Hebrew for example.
By default, Windows OS displays letters from left to right side but since it also supports other languages it supports writing from right to left side. There is a unicode character that flips the text to the right-to-left side (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u202E</code>) and you can combine it with the already existing text.
Basically, you can reverse text in file names and that way hide the true file extension.</p>

By default file extensions are hidden. I believe there is no point performing this type of name spoofing if the target Windows OS is hidding file extensions.</em></h5>
<p><br />
I have written a simple <a href="https://github.com/ExAndroidDev/rtlo-attack" target="blank">tool</a> in c# that spoofs the extension of a desired executable as well as changes the icon to anything you would like.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-the-tool">How to use the tool?</h3>
<p>The tool accepts two arguments, the first one is the input executable and the second is the icon. Since I don‚Äôt know how to easily explain how to use my tool I will try to explain it through examples.</p>

<p>Firstly you need to rename your executable to suits the required format before passing it into the tool. 
	Make sure that extension you would like to spoof is the last part before the true extension. For example if you want to make a file look like ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.png</code>‚Äù make sure your executable name is something like ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple.exemple</code><strong>.png.</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exe</code>‚Äù.
Also, make sure that the true extension, let‚Äôs say it is ‚Äú.exe‚Äù or ‚Äú.scr‚Äù, is present in the filename, wheter in its true form or reversed ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exe.</code>‚Äù or ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rcs.</code>‚Äù. Like ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple</code><strong>.exe</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mple.png.exe</code>‚Äù. (More details on reversed extension below.)</p>

<p>Once you rename your executable to match the required format pass it to the tool as a first argument along with the desired icon. <br /></p>
<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./rtlo-attack.exe simple.exemple.png.exe png.ico
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/example-1.png" alt="example-1" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The tool works by taking the file extension, like in the previous example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> and finding the match inside the executable‚Äôs name. After the match is found, it adds rtlo and ltro characters to hide the actual extension and preserve the ordinary-looking name. If you are interested in more details take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ExAndroidDev/rtlo-attack/blob/main/Program.cs#L47">source code</a>.</p>

<h3 id="additional-obfuscation">Additional obfuscation</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned a few paragraphs above, you can also reverse the true file extension to obfuscate it even more. 
Let‚Äôs take a look at the next example. I am going to use ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.scr</code>‚Äù extension, since reversing ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exe</code>‚Äù doesn‚Äôt look much different.</p>
<h5 id="note-to-create-an-scr-executable-just-change-the-file-extension-from-exe-to-scr-and-the-executable-will-still-run"><em>Note: To create an ‚Äú.scr‚Äù executable just change the file extension from ‚Äú.exe‚Äù to ‚Äú.scr‚Äù and the executable will still run.</em></h5>
<p><br />
So let‚Äôs rename an executable to meet filename format requirements before we pass it to the tool. Rename the executable to something like ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My-pictu</code><strong>rcs.</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">png.scr</code>‚Äù and pass it to the tool. Notice how we specified the true file extension but in reverse (‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rcs.</code>‚Äù) in the file name. After the tool has done it‚Äôs magic the resulting executable name will look like this ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My-picturcs.png</code>‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/example-2.png" alt="example-2" class="center-image" />
<br /></p>

<p>The other interesting way of obfuscation is chaging extension casing. Since Windows OS doesn‚Äôt care about lower or upper case, you can have an extension such as ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exE</code>‚Äù.
An example executable can look like this ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My</code><strong>.exE</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvironment.png.exE</code>‚Äù and the output would end up looking like this: ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My.exEnvironment.png</code>‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/example-3.png" alt="example-3" class="center-image" />
<br /></p>

<p>There are variety executable file extensions, but keep in mind that not all of them can have a custom icon. For example you can‚Äôt change the icon of the ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bat</code>‚Äù or ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com</code>‚Äù file types.</p>
