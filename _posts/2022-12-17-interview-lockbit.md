A3: I like pentest with postpaid.

\\\\

Q4: What's the best advice you can give to hacked companies other than "patch your shit up"?

A4: Don't go to recovery companies, they charge you their percentage so you pay more than you would have paid if you had dealt with us directly.

\\\\

Q5: What are your hobbies besides hacking and extortion?

A5: I like flying helicopters, lambos and yachts.

\\\\

Q6: Do you feel regret after you ransom the company?

\\\\

Q8: What do you do to cover/protect your identities?

A13: Not yet.

\\\\

Q14: What's your opinion on Conti's downfall, are you afraid it could happen to you as well?

Q21: Do you think it's safe to use Tor and the Tor Browser?

A21: Not safe enough, anonymity is a set of measures, not just Tor.

\\\\

Q22: Are there any programs or services that should be avoided?

A22: I don't understand the question.

\\\\

Q23: Are the local neighbors good?

A23: Don't understand the question.

\\\\

Q24: Do you want to get rid of any kind of DRM (or any similar kind of "protection" in things), and if so, do you have any examples of how annoying it is?

A24: I don't understand the question.

\\\\

Q25: What software and hardware do you use for development?

A25: It's classified information, I can't give it out because then the FBI could catch me.

\\\\

Q26: What do you want to improve in smartphones (or even in other smart devices) that contradicts the current situation (for example, what gimmicks do you want to get rid of)?

A26: I want the iPhone to have a hardware button to turn off microphones and cameras.

\\\\

Q27: Do you deal with initial access brokers or do you go all the way through the attack yourself? 
	- If so, do you just buy slots blind or do they sell you access for a specific company?

A27: Yes I deal with brokers, but there are times when I get access myself.

\\\\

A29: Secret information.

\\\\

Q30: What is your opinion of hacktivism? 
	- Do you consider it a valid form of political action, or do you think it crosses ethical boundaries compared to traditional forms of political activism? 

A30: I'm not interested in politics because it's a very dirty business, I just do post-paid pentest, a simple worker benefiting the world.

\\\\

Q31: How do you feel about the Rust vs C/C++ discussion? 

	- How do you think switching to Rust would affect your work in developing the Linux kernel, for example? 

A31: I think that if the need arises I will hire developers for any programming language and write any necessary software as long as it is not required.

\\\\

Q32: Do you have another job or is this your main job? 

A32: Yes I have a legal job in order to legalize money obtained by criminal means, this is one of the main rules of anonymity, 
you only need to spend legalized money so I never get caught.

\\\\

Q33: How do you explain your profession to your friends and relatives?

A33: My friends and relatives think I'm a great restaurateur, they love to eat at my restaurants.

\\\\

Q34: Do you expect extortion to become economically unsustainable for extortionists in the next 5 to 10 years, 
and if so, what new ways of making money might your group switch to?

A34: Postpaid Pentest will be relevant at all times because the files we steal will always be of value.

\\\\

Q35: How many paying and non-publishing victims do you currently have?

A35: On average, 3 and 10 victims pay if you sample per 1,000 companies attacked. So 300 companies out of 1,000 paid ransoms. 
But sometimes 1 company out of 1000 can pay more than all the companies that paid, for example 1 paid 50 million dollars and 299 paid 100 thousand dollars.

\\\\

Q36: What color underwear are you wearing? 

A36: My favorite color is black underwear with FBI written on it.

\\\\

Q37: What do we expect from your team in the future?

A37: Right now I'm developing new services that will take out all the competition. 
I can't tell you about them because then the competitors will start doing something similar.

\\\\

Q38: What do you think about the crisis in Russia and Ukraine?

A38: I think it is very bad, people should not die, I wish it would be over soon, but my biggest worry is about World War III, my house in New York will not survive it, 
and a bed of cash dollars will burn in nuclear ashes. 

\\\\

Q39: How many branches do you have?

A39: Over 100.

THE-KEY SIDENOTE: branches = Affiliates, Lockbitsupp appears to have translated the questions back and forth.

\\\\

Q40: How many people are in your group?

A40: More than 10.

\\\\

Q41: Do you have members in the West, if so which countries?


A41: My partners are all over the world, just recently one of them was detained in Canada. 
If you count the partners from USA, Canada and Europe only then there are about 30. I personally live in USA at the moment and I like to pass by FBI building, 
these doughnut eaters can't even imagine who passes in front of their noses. There are partners from the Arab Emirates, Iran, China and Japan.

Q44: Who is your favorite world leader?

A45: I am reliably aware of only three girls, all the rest are men.

\\\\

Q46: Do you create your own malware or do you buy ready-made malware?
